Passionfruit helps companies answer complex questionnaires at scale, especially in sustainability, quality, and compliance reporting. To do this effectively, it structures its domain around a few core concepts. Understanding these concepts will help you make the most of Passionfruit.

## Questionnaires

A Questionnaire is the core unit of work in Passionfruit. It represents a set of questions a company needs to answer—often coming from sustainability frameworks like CDP, CSRD, EcoVadis, or customer-specific audits.

A questionnaire in Passionfruit can be:
- Created manually
- Generated based on previous templates
- An Excel, Word or browser form. 

Every questionnaire is uniquely identified and versioned, enabling teams to track changes over time and reuse previous work.

## Questions & Answers

Each questionnaire consists of multiple Questions, which can be:
- Free text questions
- Multiple-choice questions
- Tables or matrix-style inputs
- Numeric fields
- File uploads or evidence requirements

Answers are stored alongside questions. Passionfruit ensures:
- All answers are tracked with metadata (who answered, when, and with what evidence)
- Versioning to maintain historical records
- Semantic mapping so similar questions can be recognized across questionnaires

## Approved Answer Library

Passionfruit maintains an Approved Answer Library (sometimes nicknamed the "Antwerp Bibliotheek"). This is a knowledge base of previously vetted answers that can be reused in new questionnaires.

Benefits of the library:
- Speeds up questionnaire completion
- Ensures consistency in responses
- Reduces errors and omissions
- Stores references to supporting documents (e.g. policies, reports)

Whenever Passionfruit recognizes that a question is similar to a past one, it can suggest an answer from the library for review.

## Knowledge base

Many questionnaires require Evidence — documents, spreadsheets, certificates, or policies that substantiate the answers. Passionfruit manages evidence as first-class objects:
- Stored in dedicated evidence buckets (e.g. S3)
- Version-controlled to ensure the latest documents are used
- Linked directly to questions and answers
- Health-checked for validity, approval status, and expiry dates

Evidence integrity is critical for audits and regulatory compliance.

## Workflows

Passionfruit structures the process of completing questionnaires into Workflows, supporting:
- Drafting and reviewing answers
- Tagging questions for team members
- Tracking progress across large questionnaires
- Managing approval cycles

Workflows help teams collaborate and ensure that complex submissions are completed accurately and on time.

## Automation & AI

A major goal of Passionfruit is to reduce the manual work involved in questionnaire answering. It uses AI for:
- Semantic search: finding similar past questions
- Answer generation: drafting responses based on past answers and documents
- Formatting answers into required structures (e.g. tables, free text)
- Confidence scoring to signal how reliable an auto-suggested answer might be

Even when using AI, Passionfruit keeps humans in the loop. Users always review and approve suggested answers.

## Import & Export

Passionfruit connects with many external systems. It supports:
- Importing questionnaires from Excel, Word, PDF, and portals
- Exporting completed questionnaires back into customer-required formats
- Generating audit trails for submissions

This flexibility allows companies to integrate Passionfruit into existing processes.

## Multi-Environment Management

Passionfruit typically operates across environments:
- Development for testing
- Staging for pre-production validation
- Production for live data

Scripts and tools (like DynamoDB migration utilities) help move data safely between environments without data loss or duplication.

## Security & Compliance

Given the sensitive nature of sustainability and compliance data, Passionfruit emphasizes:
- Strict access controls
- Encrypted storage
- API auditing and logging
- Versioning of both data and evidence
- Alignment with regulatory standards like GDPR, ISO 27001, etc.

Security is integral to Passionfruit's design.

## Passionfruit's Philosophy

At its core, Passionfruit aims to:
- Reduce repetitive work by leveraging AI and past data
- Ensure consistency and quality in compliance reporting
- Empower teams to collaborate efficiently
- Maintain auditable records to withstand regulatory scrutiny

By understanding these core concepts, you'll be ready to navigate Passionfruit and make your compliance processes smoother and faster.
