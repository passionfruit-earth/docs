## Overview

Excel functions allow you to generate answers to questions in bulk using Passionfruit's AI capabilities. You can process individual questions or combine multiple cells to create comprehensive queries.

  ></video>
</div>

### Individual Questions

To answer a single question, use the `PASSIONFRUIT.ASK` function with a cell reference:

```excel
=PASSIONFRUIT.ASK(A1)
```

This will generate an answer for the question in cell A1.

### Combining Multiple Cells

To combine questions from multiple cells into a single query, use the `CONCAT` function:

```excel
=PASSIONFRUIT.ASK(CONCAT(C1, C4))
```

This combines the content of cells C1 and C4 into one question before sending it to Passionfruit.

## Advanced Techniques

### Pinning Cell References

When you want to keep one cell reference fixed while allowing others to change when copying formulas, use the `$` symbol:

```excel
=PASSIONFRUIT.ASK(CONCAT($C$1, C4))
```

- `$C$1` - Both row and column are pinned (absolute reference)
- `C4` - Both row and column will change when copied (relative reference)

### Mixed References

You can also use mixed references for more flexible formulas:

```excel
=PASSIONFRUIT.ASK(CONCAT($C1, C$4))
```

- `$C1` - Column C is pinned, row 1 will change when copied
- `C$4` - Row 4 is pinned, column C will change when copied

## Reviewing Answers

### Side Panel Monitoring

As answers are generated, they appear in the Passionfruit side panel:

1. **Real-time Updates** - Watch as answers arrive in the side panel
2. **Click to Review** - Click on any answer to review the generated content

### Answer Quality

Each generated answer includes:
- **Confidence Level** - Shows how certain the AI is about the answer
- **Source References** - Links to relevant documents or sources
- **Context** - Additional information that supports the answer

## Best Practices

### Formula Structure

```excel
=PASSIONFRUIT.ASK(CONCAT(reference1, " ", reference2))
```

- Always use `CONCAT` to combine multiple cells
- Add spaces between combined content for better readability
- Use absolute references (`$`) for template cells that shouldn't change



### Error Handling

If a formula doesn't work as expected:
1. Check that all referenced cells contain valid content
2. Ensure the `CONCAT` function is properly formatted
3. Verify that Passionfruit is connected and accessible

## Examples

### Simple Question Answering

| Question | Formula | Result |
|----------|---------|--------|
| "What is quality policy?" | `=PASSIONFRUIT.ASK(A1)` | Generated answer appears |

### Combined Questions

| Questions | Formula | Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| A1: "Quality policy?"<br/>A2: "Food safety?" | `=PASSIONFRUIT.ASK(CONCAT(A1, " and ", A2))` | Combined answer for both topics |

### Template with Fixed References

| Template | Formula | Result |
|----------|---------|--------|
| $A$1: "Describe your"<br/>B2: "quality system" | `=PASSIONFRUIT.ASK(CONCAT($A$1, " ", B2))` | "Describe your quality system" |

## Troubleshooting


**Formula not working:**
- Check cell references are correct
- Ensure Passionfruit is connected
- Verify question content is not empty

**Answers not appearing:**
- Check the side panel for generated answers
- Click on answers to review and copy them
