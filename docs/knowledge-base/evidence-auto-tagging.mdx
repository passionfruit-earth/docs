Auto‑tagging reads new uploads and suggests rich metadata automatically—so you don’t have to maintain it by hand and your knowledge stays organised. We detect type, source, and related entities, and propose other helpful attributes for review.

- Evidence is automatically tagged with type, source, and detected entities
- Tags improve search and filtering; you can edit or add your own
- See the [changelog](/changelog) for recent accuracy and coverage improvements
