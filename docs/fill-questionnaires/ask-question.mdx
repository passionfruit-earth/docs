Chat is the simplest way to get answers: ask a question in plain language and get a concise response with citations you can verify.

You can get answers in two ways: Chat and Auto‑fill. Chat lets you use human language to find information quickly, with citations you can open and verify. Auto‑fill does the typing for you where available.

1. Open Chat in the App or the Extension
2. Ask your question
3. Review the suggested answer and its citations
4. Open sources to verify details
5. Insert or copy the answer where you need it

## Auto‑fill
Auto‑fill places answers directly where you need them. The first Auto‑fill feature is Excel functions—formulas that pull suggested answers and citations into cells for quick review and approval. Learn more in [Excel functions](/docs/fill-questionnaires/excel-functions).
