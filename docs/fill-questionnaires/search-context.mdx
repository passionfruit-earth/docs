#### Overview
Narrow your search context by specifying the exact evidence and answers to reference. Filter evidence and answers by related entities, or manually select individual sources, to get results that are most relevant to your needs.

#### Filter on entity

Instantly limit your search context to everything that is relevant for one or more entities. When you choose specific entities, only the evidence and answers linked to those entities will be considered, keeping your results focused and precise.
