#### Overview

You can narrow what Passionfruit searches when you ask a question: filter by company or subsidiary, or pick specific evidence files and answer library items. Results stay focused and relevant. The steps below describe how.

#### Filter on entities

Limit search to everything linked to one or more companies or subsidiaries—only that evidence and those answers are used, so you don't mix information. In the search context, select one or more entities and click **Apply**.

    playsInline
    className="w-full h-full"

</div>

#### Manual selecting

Choose exactly which evidence files and answer library items to include—answers then cite only those sources. In the search context, tick the files or answer library items you want and click **Apply**. You can combine this with a filter on entities so the list shows only what's relevant.

#### Steps

1. Open **Chat** and set the questionnaire and any entities.
2. Open the search context (source or filter area) and either **filter by entities** or **manually select** specific evidence and answer library items.
3. Click **Apply** to save your context.
4. Ask your question; answers use only the evidence and answers you included.
5. Review the cited answer and adjust context if needed, then ask again.
