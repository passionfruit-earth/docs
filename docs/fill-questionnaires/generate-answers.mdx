#### Overview
We find the best content from your workspace and draft a concise response with citations you can verify.

## How it works
<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand your question and context">
    We read the question text and capture context (entity, framework, tags). We use any selected scope to constrain sources.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the Answer Library first">
    If a matching approved answer exists, we use it as the base. If not found, we continue to evidence.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search your Evidence base">
    We retrieve and rank the most relevant documents and entities. We prioritize approved and recent content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Draft a tailored answer">
    We phrase the answer to fit the questionnaireâ€™s wording and field. We include citations so you can verify and drill into sources.
  </Step>
