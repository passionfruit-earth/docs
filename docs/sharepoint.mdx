#### Overview
Connect Passionfruit to SharePoint Online to discover and reuse the right evidence while filling questionnaires. This integration is offered as a managed setup: you request access, and we configure everything with your team using Microsoft Entra ID.

<Info> Available on request. Email `hello@passionfruit.earth` to get started.</Info>

#### Authentication and Security

The SharePoint integration leverages Microsoft Entra ID for secure authentication and access control. This ensures:

- **Seamless SSO**: If your organisation has configured [Single Sign-On with Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/installation/sso-setup), users can access SharePoint-synced evidence using the same credentials
- **Enterprise security**: Benefit from your existing Microsoft Entra ID security policies, including multi-factor authentication and conditional access rules
- **Secure data access**: All SharePoint access is authenticated through Microsoft Entra ID, ensuring only authorized users can sync and access evidence

#### Purpose
Syncing evidence files with your Knowledge Base keeps your source documents authoritative while making them instantly reusable across Passionfruit.

- **Single source of truth**: Files stay in SharePoint, while Passionfruit indexes them so your team can search, reference, and reuse the latest versions during questionnaires.
- **Always up to date**: Changes at the source are reflected automatically, removing manual re-uploads and stale copies.
- **Governance and analytics**: Centralized visibility for expiry tracking, approvals, ownership, and usage insights.
- **Speed and consistency**: Reuse approved evidence and answers, reducing duplicate work and ensuring consistent responses.

#### Evidence Syncing

The SharePoint integration enables automatic evidence syncing from your SharePoint sites to your Passionfruit Knowledge Base. This allows you to:

- **Select specific sources**: Choose which SharePoint sites, libraries, or folders should be synced with your Knowledge Base
- **Automatic updates**: Evidence files are automatically indexed and updated when changes occur in SharePoint
- **Search and discovery**: Synced evidence becomes searchable within Passionfruit, making it easy to find and reference during questionnaire filling
- **Compliance tracking**: Maintain visibility into evidence sources, ownership, and modification dates directly from SharePoint metadata

#### What is synced
- Selected sites, libraries, or folders and their files.
- Rich metadata used for discovery and compliance (for example: title, type, size, creator/owner, modified/created timestamps, and path).
- File content for search and answer generation where supported (e.g., PDFs, Office documents, and images with text extraction where available).
