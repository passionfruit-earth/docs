### Overview
The dashboard gives a quick snapshot of your Knowledge Base: how many items you have and what needs attention right now.

### What you see
- **Progress header**: A short description of the page intent.
- **Entities card**: Shows the total number of entities in your workspace with a **View** button to open the full entities list.
- **Answer Library card**: Displays the total count of answers stored, with a **View** button to jump to the answer library.
- **Evidence panel**: Highlights the top expiring evidence items so you can act before they become outdated. Each row shows:
  - the file name and type
  - days remaining until expiration
  - quick access via the **View** button for the full Evidence page

### Tips
- Use the **View** buttons on each card to navigate directly to that section.
- Review expiring evidence regularly to keep your Knowledge Base up to date.
