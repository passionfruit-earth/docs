###### Overview
Passionfruit has two ways to work with the same workspace, knowledge, and permissions.

No installation is required for the Home web app—just sign in at [app.passionfruit.earth](https://app.passionfruit.earth). To add Excel/Word and browser capabilities, follow the steps on the [Install](/docs/installation/install) page.

• Microsoft Office add-ins: install via Microsoft AppSource or from within Office

• Browser extension: install from the Chrome Web Store or Edge Add-ons

#### <Icon icon="browser" size={16} />  App
Your control center to manage knowledge and organization. It's the central place where all information flows back to. Here you connect to your integrations, manage users, and configure permissions. Accessible via [app.passionfruit.earth](https://app.passionfruit.earth).

#### <Icon icon="mobile" size={16} /> Extensions 
 Use the extensions directly in applications where you already complete questionnaires, such as Excel, Word, and browser-based portals, allowing you to remain in your familiar tools. Easily find and insert answers with citations without needing to switch apps. Review and update any necessary data from the add-ins or the Home web app. Each extension offers tools designed for its specific host app to assist in filling out questionnaires. We are continuously expanding capabilities to auto-fill answers; the first feature available is [Excel functions](/docs/excel-functions), which provides formulas to pull suggested answers and citations directly into cells for quick review and approval. For installation instructions, visit the [Install](/docs/installation/install) page.
