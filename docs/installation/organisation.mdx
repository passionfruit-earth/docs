#### Overview
Organisations are groups of users. Configure company-wide settings, manage members and roles, set up workspaces, and share resources so teams can collaborate effectively.

<Info> Managed in the app only: Organisation settings can only be managed from the Passionfruit app. See the [App & Integrations](/docs/installation/apps) for where to find it.</Info>


You can find Organisation settings by clicking your avatar in the top left, then choosing Settings, then Organisation.

In Organisation settings, you can invite and remove members and manage roles and permissions, create and manage shared workspaces, configure naming conventions and metadata, and set organisation-wide security and compliance preferences.
