#### Overview
Organisations are groups of users. Configure company-wide settings, manage members and roles, set up workspaces, and share resources so teams can collaborate effectively.

<Info> Managed in the app only: Organisation settings can only be managed from the Passionfruit app. See the [App & Integrations](/docs/installation/apps) for where to find it.</Info>


You can find Organisation settings by clicking your avatar in the top left, then choosing Settings, then Organisation.

In Organisation settings, you can invite and remove members and manage roles and permissions, create and manage shared workspaces, configure naming conventions and metadata, and set organisation-wide security and compliance preferences.

#### Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft Entra ID

Enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for your organisation using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) to provide a seamless and secure authentication experience for your team.

**Benefits:**
- **Unified authentication**: Users can sign in with their Microsoft credentials, including support for multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- **Enhanced security**: Leverage your existing Microsoft Entra ID security policies, including conditional access and two-factor authentication
- **Streamlined access**: Users are automatically authenticated when they access Passionfruit, reducing password fatigue
- **Centralized user management**: User provisioning and deprovisioning is managed through Microsoft Entra ID

<Info> SSO setup is a managed process. See the [SSO guide](/docs/installation/sso) for administrators, or contact `hello@passionfruit.earth` to get started.</Info>

Once configured, users can choose to sign in with their Microsoft account (using SSO) or continue using their Passionfruit password. SSO users benefit from your organisation's Microsoft Entra ID security policies, including multi-factor authentication requirements.
