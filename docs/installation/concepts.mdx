Passionfruit helps companies answer complex questionnaires at scale (sustainability, quality, compliance). These are the essential concepts you need to get started.


## Core concepts

- Questionnaire: complete in Excel, Word, or the web; progress and reviews are tracked.
- Evidence: your source documents and links used to substantiate answers.
- Answer Library: previously approved answers you can reuse.
- Entities: organisation records (suppliers, clients, locations) to anchor answers and evidence.
- Agent: AI that finds and drafts grounded, cited answers from your workspace.
- Where you use it: Home web app and Extensions (Office add‑ins and Browser). Everything stays in sync.

## Questionnaires
Questionnaires are the unit of work. Fill them where they live (Excel, Word, or a portal) using the add‑ins or the browser extension. All changes sync with Passionfruit so you can track progress, reviews, and approvals.


## Knowledge
Passionfruit centralizes your knowledge so answers are consistent, traceable, and reusable.

### Evidence
Documents that substantiate answers; tracked for freshness, approval, and version history.

### Entities
Organisation records with key attributes. Use them to attach answers and evidence to the right context.

### Answer Library
Approved answers ready to reuse. When a new question looks similar, Passionfruit suggests a library answer for review.


## Agent
The Answer Agent uses your Evidence, Entities, and Answer Library to propose cited, verifiable answers. It prioritises approved content and always shows where information comes from.


## Workspace basics
- Members & roles: Invite teammates and partners with scoped access.
- Shared data model: Answers, evidence, and entities stay linked end‑to‑end.
- Integrations: Connect sources to streamline evidence collection and access.
- Governance: Version history and an auditable activity log.
