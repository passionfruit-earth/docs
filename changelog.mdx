Stay in flow with a focused interface, accurate auto-tagging, and quicker performance across the app and add-ins.

#### Renewed interface

A refreshed, cleaner look that’s easier to read. Evidence search is simpler with clearer filters, so you can narrow results and find the right file fast. Fewer distractions, quicker decisions.

#### Manage knowledge without leaving your document

Work from the app you’re in. No need to switch to the main app. Manage evidence, answers, and entities right in the add‑in so you never break your workflow. Everything stays in sync across Passionfruit.

#### Evidence organized for you

Evidence is automatically organized on upload with accurate auto‑tagging and context awareness. Related entities are detected to keep evidence and answers neatly grouped. This reduces manual tagging and keeps knowledge structured as it grows.

#### Stay ahead of expirations

Expiry and review dates are picked up automatically when you upload. We surface upcoming renewals so you can review on time and keep information current. No manual tracking needed.
