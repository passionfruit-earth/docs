Chat improvements and PDF viewer</p>

We've fixed critical login issues that were blocking Excel users from accessing Passionfruit, and added the ability to view PDF evidence directly within the Excel add-in. You can now see the source documents that inform AI answers without switching between applications.

**Enhanced messaging interface**

- The conversation view has been redesigned for cleaner presentation and better source referencing
- Improved context handling means answers now reference your actual company name instead of generic placeholders

**Enhanced reasoning**

- Even when the AI can't find a specific answer, it now provides clear explanations of what it searched and why certain information might be missing
- Clickable source citations take you directly to the relevant PDF sections and evidence locations
