#### Find company information

Company information — addresses, VAT numbers, codes, and other details — lives in one place and is organized by entity. Each entity has its own set, automatically filled and always up to date. When you search, Passionfruit finds the right information for the entity you’re working with. Answers and evidence stay filtered to that entity so you don’t mix information between companies or subsidiaries.

    className="w-full h-full"
    src="/videos/changelog/REL26-company-info-search.mp4"
  ></video>
</div>

#### Switch to another company or subsidiary

When you need to work with a different company or subsidiary, switch in one click. Your answers and evidence stay scoped to the one you choose, so you never mix information between them.

<div className="bg-[#FDFDFD] rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden outline-[0.5px] outline outline-black/10 aspect-video">

    src="/videos/changelog/REL26-quick-entity-switcher.mp4"
  ></video>
</div>

#### Other improvements

- **Copy from PDFs** — Copy and paste text from PDFs straight into Passionfruit; selection and copy work reliably and stay visible.
- **Answer library** — Saved answers keep your exact wording. When you save an answer to the library, we now store the sources that were actually cited. Tables can’t be saved in answers, so the library stays clean and consistent.
- **Search** — Search is better at finding the right information on the first try. When you filter by entities only, evidence and answers are included by default so results stay relevant. Source counts show how many files and answers were used (and show “None” when zero). When nothing is found, you still see what was searched.
- **Copy and feedback** — Copy answers with clear visual feedback. Tables in answers support copy and citations. The feedback modal shows which question you’re commenting on.

#### Bug fixes and polish

- **Copy from PDFs** — Copy and paste text from evidence PDFs straight into Passionfruit; selection and copy work reliably, stay visible, and no longer misalign. The viewer scrolls correctly to citations and works with large files.
- Answer review: copy answer works again; confidence scores display correctly.
- Modals and layout: improved spacing and sizing; long answers no longer overflow the page.
- Feedback submission and a few styling and display tweaks across the app.

#### Bulk edit

In the main application, edit multiple evidence, entities, or answers at once. Change one field while the rest stay locked, or update many items in a single go.

#### Filter on entities

Instantly limit your search context to everything that is relevant for one or more entities. When you choose specific entities, only the evidence and answers linked to those entities will be considered, keeping your results focused and precise.

<div className="bg-[#FDFDFD] rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden outline-[0.5px] outline outline-black/10 aspect-video">

    className="w-full h-full"
    src="/videos/changelog/REL25-search-config.mp4"
  ></video>
</div>

#### Manual selecting

Select specific sources to include in your search context. Choose individual evidence files or answer library items to narrow your search, ensuring answers come only from the sources you specify.

<div className="bg-[#FDFDFD] rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden outline-[0.5px] outline outline-black/10 aspect-video">

## November 19, 2025

The Passionfruit Agent just got a major upgrade. It understands your questions better, searches with deeper context, and brings the right evidence forward faster.

#### Answer multiple questions at once

You can now ask multiple related questions at once, and Passionfruit will answer each one, citing sources for every response.

<div className="bg-[#FDFDFD] rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden outline-[0.5px] outline outline-black/10 aspect-video">
  <video

    playsInline
    className="w-full h-full"
    src="/videos/REL24-follow-up-questions.mp4"
  ></video>
</div>
<Info>Tip: For best results, try to ask no more than 5 questions at once.</Info>
#### Smarter reasoning

Passionfruit now better understands what you mean and brings the right context together. Answers are clearer and more consistent, explain how they were reached, and always link back to their sources.

#### Review mode

      className="my-0"
    />
  </div>
</div>

#### Split view

Drag the extension sidebar wider to expand split view, giving you more room to review sources next to answers.

<div className="outline-[0.5px] outline outline-black/10 rounded-lg overflow-hidden bg-[#F8F7F4]">
